## Context

The [mockup design file](mockup.png) is a representation of a minimal page builder. The challenge is to build this page using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
You should use webpack to build your assets, so take time to structure everything and setup the build process. You have a choice to code it from scratch or use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Evaluation criteria ðŸš¨

- Accuracy to follow instructions.
- W3C Recommendations.
- Code readability.
